# Twitter_Disaster_Analysis


This project leverages natural language processing and machine learning to classify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. The analysis is based on a dataset of tweets labeled by relevance to disaster response.

## Overview

- Goal: Automatically detect tweets that describe real disaster situations.
- Approach: Data cleaning, tokenization, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Google Colab.

  
### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
